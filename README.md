# Open Idle

An experimental idle game built in the browser.

## Why?

I wanted an excuse to mess around with Sveltekit, but to also epxlore some mathematics and polish up on some skills. Idle games are also relatively approachable in terms of mechanics, and seemed like a fun way to explore some rapid prototyping of concepts.
I also think collaborating on an idle game sounds like a really cool idea.

## Why SvelteKit?

I use Svelte in a lot of projects and wanted an excuse to check out SvelteKit, it also seemed like a good way to rapidly get a project up and running with minimal fuss. It has a very low skll entry point for me too with previous experience with Svelte. I wanted to avoid learning a new framework and reduce the overhead in getting the project off the ground.
